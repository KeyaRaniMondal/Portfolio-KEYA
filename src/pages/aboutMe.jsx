                        Hello! Iâ€™m <span className="font-bold text-[#4A90E2]">Keya Rani Mondal</span>, a
                        **dedicated Web Developer** and a 3rd-year CSE student. My journey into programming
                        began with curiosity about how websites function behind the scenes. Over time, I
                        found myself drawn to <span className="font-semibold text-[#FF9F43]">Front-End Development</span>,
                        where creativity meets logic to create stunning digital experiences.

                    <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
                        I specialize in <span className="font-semibold text-[#A29BFE]">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, express js, node js and NoSQL database Mongodb</span>,
                        focusing on responsive design and user-friendly interfaces. I thrive on solving complex
                        coding problems, optimizing performance, and bringing ideas to life through code.
                        **Continuous learning** is my passion, and Iâ€™m always eager to explore new
                        technologies in this ever-evolving industry.
